# Gameware
_A prototype for a programming language to build video games._

### What is Gameware?
Gameware is a game development environment. It contains a built in programming language with dedicated syntax for writing video game code smoothly.

### How does Gameware work?
**PlayScript** is the scripting language behind Gameware. The user writes the game code in **PlayScript**. **PlayScript** code is then transcompiled into its equivalent HTML+javaScript form to create a HTML5 compatible game which can run in a client browser.

### How can you contribute?
The project contains two major parts
- Programming Language
- Game Engine

#### Contribution to the language.
Anyone trying to contribute to the project can try to improve the existing **PlayScript** language syntax or add new functionalities in the language.
#### Contribution to the engine.
If you want to improve the Engine, which contains interacting with [kiwi.js](https://github.com/gamelab/kiwi.js/) libraries to implement newer game mechanics or the user interface or even the non core backend(file structure etc), you can do so.

To contribute, you must know the following
- Java
- JavaScript
- [kiwi.js](https://github.com/gamelab/kiwi.js/)
